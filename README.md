# Home Model for Security and Automation in IoT
The aim of this project was to create an IoT physical model which replicates a house-hold and any parts than can be automated or integrated with a web application. It is my dissertation project for 2018 which was used as a proof of concept of IoT in commercial practice, showing and explaining that the technology is not to be ignored in future household integration.

## Technologies
###### Front end
The web application is made only using **React.js**, with a few dependencies which are listed below. Components are split into seperate files and their respect .css file rather than using inline styles, for example:
> ./controls.js, ./controls.css

###### Back end
C

###### Databasing
AWS IoT

## Dependencies
-font-awesome
